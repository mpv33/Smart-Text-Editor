Chairman of Indian Space Research Organisation K Sivan
 said on Saturday that the space agency will try to establish
  a link with the lander for 14 days.
   After lander Vikram was located on the
    lunar surface by Chandrayaan 2's onboard cameras on Sunday,
 he reiterated that those efforts would continue.
